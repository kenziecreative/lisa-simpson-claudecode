## TechFlow Launches AI-Powered Enterprise Analytics Platform

### *First Solution to Combine Natural Language Queries with Petabyte-Scale Performance; Three Fortune 500 Companies Already Deployed*

**SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 15, 2026** — TechFlow today announced the general availability of its AI-powered enterprise analytics platform, the first solution to combine natural language querying with sub-second performance on petabyte-scale data. The platform enables business users to explore enterprise data independently, reducing analytics deployment time from months to weeks while eliminating SQL expertise requirements.

Three Fortune 500 companies have already deployed the platform in production, collectively processing more than 10 billion queries per month. Early adopters report 95 percent reduction in report creation time and significant cost savings from reduced analyst workload.

"Enterprise teams are stuck between legacy BI platforms that require armies of SQL experts and simple consumer tools that lack enterprise capabilities," said Sarah Chen, chief executive officer at TechFlow. "We built TechFlow Enterprise Analytics to bridge that gap—delivering petabyte-scale performance with a natural language interface that business users actually want to use."

The platform addresses a critical enterprise challenge: data infrastructure investments have created massive data repositories, but business teams still wait weeks for insights while data teams drown in report requests. Traditional business intelligence platforms require SQL expertise for every analysis, creating bottlenecks that slow decision-making.

**Key Platform Capabilities:**

- **Natural Language Queries**: Business users ask questions in plain English; AI translates to optimized SQL that respects security policies and governance rules
- **Enterprise Scale**: Sub-second query performance on billions of rows across data warehouses, databases, and SaaS platforms
- **Rapid Deployment**: Pre-built connectors for 500-plus data sources enable implementation in weeks instead of months
- **Automated Insights**: AI-powered anomaly detection flags data outliers and trends without manual analysis
- **Enterprise Security**: SOC 2 Type II certified with row-level security, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit logging

TechCorp, a global manufacturing company with 50,000 employees, deployed TechFlow Enterprise Analytics to automate its financial reporting workflow. The finance team previously spent two weeks each quarter manually pulling data from 15 systems and reconciling in spreadsheets.

"We reduced quarterly report creation from two weeks to two minutes," said Jane Martinez, chief financial officer at TechCorp. "Our team shifted from manual data wrangling to strategic analysis. The ROI was immediate—we're saving more than $500,000 annually in analyst time while making faster, better-informed decisions."

The platform integrates with existing enterprise data infrastructure including Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and hundreds of SaaS applications. Data remains in customer infrastructure with read-only access, addressing security and compliance requirements for regulated industries.

TechFlow Enterprise Analytics is available immediately with transparent per-user pricing starting at $499 per month for annual contracts. The company offers a 30-day free trial with full platform access and dedicated onboarding support.
