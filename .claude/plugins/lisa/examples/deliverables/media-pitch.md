# Media Pitch: Enterprise Analytics Platform Launch

**To**: Frederic Lardinois, Senior Editor, TechCrunch
**From**: Jennifer Wilson, Director of Communications, TechFlow
**Subject**: 3 Fortune 500 companies adopt new AI analytics platform—here's why legacy BI is failing

Hi Frederic,

I've been following your coverage of the enterprise data infrastructure space—your recent piece on Snowflake's AI features was particularly insightful on the gap between data platform capabilities and analytics usability.

That gap is exactly what TechFlow is addressing with our enterprise analytics platform launching today.

**The news**: Three Fortune 500 companies are already processing 10 billion queries per month through TechFlow's AI-powered analytics platform. They're seeing 95 percent reduction in report creation time by letting business users query data in natural language instead of requiring SQL expertise for every question.

**Why this matters now**: Enterprises have invested billions in data infrastructure (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery), but their business teams still wait weeks for insights. Legacy BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) require SQL and IT support for every analysis. Simple consumer tools lack enterprise scale and security. This gap is costing enterprises millions in delayed decisions and analyst bottlenecks.

**What's different**: TechFlow combines natural language querying with petabyte-scale performance and sub-second query times. The AI translates plain English questions into optimized SQL while respecting row-level security and governance policies. Implementation takes weeks instead of months.

**Customer proof**: TechCorp (global manufacturer, 50,000 employees) reduced quarterly financial reporting from two weeks of manual work to two minutes of automated workflows. CFO Jane Martinez: "We got weekends back and make faster decisions."

**Timing angle**: This launches the same week as Tableau Conference. While Salesforce focuses on incremental improvements to legacy BI, TechFlow is fundamentally rethinking how business users access enterprise data.

**What I can offer**:
- Exclusive interview with CEO Sarah Chen (former data engineering lead at [Previous Company])
- Demo access showing natural language queries on real enterprise datasets
- Customer introduction: TechCorp CFO willing to discuss ROI and implementation
- Early access to our research on enterprise analytics bottlenecks (surveyed 500+ data teams)

Would you be interested in covering this? I'm happy to set up a briefing call this week or provide demo access immediately.

Best regards,

## Alternative Version: For Business/Financial Media

**To**: Aaron Tilley, Senior Reporter, Wall Street Journal
**From**: Jennifer Wilson, Director of Communications, TechFlow
**Subject**: Fortune 500 CFOs are automating financial reporting with AI—one saved $500K annually

Hi Aaron,

Your recent coverage of AI adoption in enterprise finance departments caught my attention—particularly the tension between technology promise and practical implementation challenges.

I wanted to share a story that illustrates real enterprise AI ROI: TechCorp's finance team automated their quarterly reporting workflow with TechFlow's AI analytics platform, reducing report creation time from two weeks to two minutes and saving more than $500,000 annually.

**The broader trend**: Enterprise finance teams waste 40 percent of their time on manual reporting—pulling data from dozens of systems, reconciling in spreadsheets, creating presentations. Meanwhile, CFOs demand faster insights for decision-making.

**What's changing**: AI-powered analytics platforms are finally delivering on the self-service BI promise that's been talked about for a decade. Business users can now ask questions in natural language and get instant answers from billions of data points without SQL expertise or IT support.

**The numbers**: TechFlow launches today with three Fortune 500 customers already processing 10 billion queries per month. Customers report 95 percent reduction in report creation time and seven-figure cost savings from reduced analyst workload.

**Why it works now**: Previous natural language BI tools couldn't handle enterprise scale or security requirements. TechFlow runs queries on petabyte-scale data with sub-second performance while enforcing row-level security and compliance policies. It's enterprise-ready, not just a demo.

**What I can offer**:
- Interview with TechCorp CFO Jane Martinez on ROI and implementation
- CEO Sarah Chen available to discuss market opportunity (enterprise BI is a $30B market)
- Access to customer ROI data and analyst time savings metrics
- Demo showing natural language queries on financial reporting workflows

This fits well with your coverage of enterprise technology adoption and C-suite digital transformation. Would you be interested in exploring this story?

Happy to discuss this week at your convenience.

Best regards,

## Alternative Version: For Trade/Industry Media

**To**: Tom Warren, Senior Editor, The Verge
**From**: Jennifer Wilson, Director of Communications, TechFlow
**Subject**: The BI tool your data team has been dreaming about—launching today

---

Hi Tom,

Quick note because I think this will resonate with your audience of technical decision-makers.

Every data engineer and analyst I've talked to says the same thing: they spend 80 percent of their time building reports for business teams and only 20 percent on strategic work. They're stuck being "report factories" instead of data scientists.

TechFlow is launching a product today that could change that dynamic: an AI analytics platform that lets business users query enterprise data in natural language while respecting all the security and governance policies data teams have built.

**The technical innovation**: Natural language processing that translates plain English to optimized, warehouse-specific SQL. Handles billions of rows with sub-second performance. Auto-adapts to schema changes so dashboards don't break. Row-level security and audit logging built in.

**Real-world proof**: Three Fortune 500 companies are already running 10 billion queries per month through the platform. Data teams report 90 percent reduction in ad-hoc report requests because business users can self-serve.

**Architecture details**: Semantic layer maps business terminology to data schemas. Query optimizer generates warehouse-specific SQL (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift). Progressive result streaming. Intelligent caching layer. All queries logged for audit and performance tuning.

**Why this is hard**: Previous natural language BI tools were toys—couldn't handle complex joins, failed on large datasets, ignored security policies. TechFlow is the first to deliver both natural language UX AND enterprise-grade performance/security.

**What I can offer**:
- Deep-dive technical briefing with VP Engineering Michael Rodriguez
- Demo access so you can test query performance and accuracy yourself
- Architecture whitepaper (how we achieve sub-second queries on petabytes)
- Customer interview: Head of Data Engineering at TechCorp on how it changed their team's workflow

Interested in taking a look? I can set up demo access immediately or arrange a technical briefing this week.

Best,
