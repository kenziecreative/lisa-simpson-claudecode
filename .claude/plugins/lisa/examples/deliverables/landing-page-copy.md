## Problem Section

### Headline (H2)
Your Data Infrastructure Is Powerful. Your Analytics Shouldn't Be Painful.

You've invested millions in data infrastructure. But your teams still wait weeks for reports. Business users can't explore data themselves. And your engineering team is drowning in analytics requests.

**The enterprise analytics problem:**
- Legacy BI tools require SQL expertise and IT support for every question
- Simple analytics tools lack the power for enterprise complexity
- Custom dashboards take months to build and break every time data schemas change
- Data scientists spend 80% of their time on data prep instead of insights

There's a better way.

## Customer Proof

### Headline (H2)
Trusted by Enterprise Teams Worldwide

#### Case Study: TechCorp
**"We reduced report creation time from 2 weeks to 2 minutes"**

TechCorp's finance team was drowning in manual reporting. Every quarter-end meant late nights pulling data from 15 systems, reconciling in spreadsheets, and creating presentations.

With TechFlow, they automated the entire workflow. Now reports generate automatically, anomalies are flagged with AI, and executives get real-time dashboards instead of static presentations.

**Results**:
- 95% reduction in report creation time
- $500K annual savings in analyst hours
- 10x faster decision-making
